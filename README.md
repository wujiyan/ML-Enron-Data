# Machine-Learning--Enron-Data
Enron was one of the largest companies in the US, however, it bankrupted in 2002. The goal of this project is to identify persons of interest, who were believed to be responsible for company fraud, based on the dataset given. In this process, I will make some data cleaning and extract key features, and then use machine learning to train the features. Finally I will test the model to see its performance.
